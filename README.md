## Personalized Cancer Diagnosis
This repository contains implementation of many classification algorithms to classify cancer classes. The Dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/,
it is provided by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) as a NIPS 2017 Competetion.

This is  case study approach and the following algorithms are implemented:

1. Maximum voting classifier
2. stacked up Classifier
3. random forest
4. Support vector classifier
5. Logistic Regression
6. KNN
7. Naive bayes 

Embeddings used to encode word to vector:

1. One hot encoding
2. Response Coding
3. tf-idf
4. bigrams and unigrams 


Plots used:

1. heat map
2. line plot

Metrics used:

1. Multi-class log-loss
2. Confusion matrix
3. precison matrix
4. recall matrix
